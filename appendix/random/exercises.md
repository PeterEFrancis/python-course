<!-- 1.  Dice Histogram: Call your class DiceHistogram.java. In this exercise, you will simulate the throwing of 2 standard six-sided dice a given number of times and display the resulting distribution as a text-based histogram. First, ask the user how many time to roll the dice. Then simulate the dice rolling and print the maximum number of times a sum was rolled. Next print lines for each possible dice roll showing a number of asterisks proportional to the number of times the sum was rolled. Scale the number of asterisks such that the sum rolled the most will have 60 asterisks.  Example transcript (user input underlined):

How many rolls? 1000000
Max count: 166039
