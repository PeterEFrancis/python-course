<!-- 
Call a function that takes in a single float and returns a single float a *math-y* function.

1. Write a function that takes in two math-y functions, and tests 10,000 random points between -1000 and 1000, to check if the functions are "approximately equal" (i.e. all the values are within 0.01 of each other).

2. Write a function `deriv` that, given a math-y function, returns a function which is approximately the derivative of that function. Use 0.0001 as an "infinitely small" value. Verify your function works by using the solution to problem 1 to check if `deriv(lambda x: x**2)` is approximately the same as `lambda x:2*x`. -->
