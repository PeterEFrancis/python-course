# Operations

As you begin to learn python, you can think of it as a glorified calculator (a LOT of glorification).

You can use python to perform all of the operations that you have used all your life, and a few more!

Just as you would expect, this bit of code will add 6 and 7:

```python
6+7
```
> 13

Here is a chart summarizing the arithmetic operations in python:

| operator | name | use | example input | output |
|:--------:|:----:|:---:|:-------------:|:------:|
| `+` | addition | add two numbers | `2+2`| `4` |
| `-` | subtraction | subtraction two numbers | `5-2`| `3` |
