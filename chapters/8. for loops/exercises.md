1. **Magic Square**. Ask the user for an odd positive integer `n` at least 3, and then print the [Magic Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_square) of size `n`.

	Algorithm:
	> To generate the magic square, use the following algorithm:  Assign 1 to our initial current position: the bottom row, middle column. Place each successive value (up to size * size) in the first of the following positions that is unoccupied: (1) one space down and to the right, or (2) one space up.  Positions wrap around the sides, top and bottom. (from Neller)

2. **Divisors**. Ask the user for an integer `n` and then print a list of all of the positive divisors of that integer.

3. **Prime Numbers**. Ask the user for an integer `n`, and then print whether `n` is prime.

4. **Unique Elements**. Define a list `a`. Then the unique elements of `a` (e.g. if `a` contains 1 twice, print 1 only once).

5. **Min, Max, Sum, and Product.** Define a list `a` of `float`s (and/or `int`s). Then print the minimum, maximum, sum, and product of `a` without using `min()`, `max()`, or `sum()`.

6. **String Palindromes.** Define a string `s`. Then print whether `s` is a palindrome. If `s` is not a palindrome, print the palindrome that has `s` as a base. For example, if `s` is `'race'`, the new palindrome that should be printed is `'racecar'`.
