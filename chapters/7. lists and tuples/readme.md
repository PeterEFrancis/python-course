`in` operator

auto unpacking of lists onto variables


It is also possible to use tuples assign multiple variables' values at once. Both

```python
a, b, c = 1, 2, 3
```
and
```python
a, b, c = (1, 2, 3)
```
and
```python
a, b, c = (1, 2, 3)
```
will set `a = 1`, `b = 2`, and `c = 3`.


.join()
.split()
