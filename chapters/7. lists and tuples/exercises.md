7. **Pig Game** (Neller). Implement a game of Pig where the user plays against a "hold at 20 or goal" computer player that rolls until a 1 ("pig") is rolled, or the turn total is greater than or equal to 20, or the score plus the turn total is greater than or equal to 100.  The first player is chosen randomly.

- Before the game, randomly select which player the user will be, and print the line "You will be player #.", where # is the user's player number. Then, print an instruction line "Enter nothing to roll; enter anything to hold."
- Before each turn, print a line with "Player 1 score: " and player 1's score.  Print another line with "Player 2 score: " and player 2's score.  Finally, print a line with "It is player #'s turn.", where "#" is replaced by the current player number.  Play starts with player 1 and then alternates.
- For each roll, print a line with "Roll: " and the random die roll value (1-6).
- For each non-"pig" roll 2-6 on the user's turn, prompt the user with "Turn total: ", the turn total, a tab, and "Roll/Hold? ".
- After a "pig" roll of 1, or a "hold", print a line with "Turn total: " followed by the turn total.  In the case of a "pig", this turn total is 0.  Then, print a line with "New score: " followed by the new score for the current player.
