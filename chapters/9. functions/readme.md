global variables, eval https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#eval


## `eval()`

Python is very special because it has the meta functionality of evaluating strings that contain lines of python code!

Observe:

```python
eval("1 + 2")
```
> `3`



typing module




recursion

variable scope


It is also possible to use tuples assign multiple variables' values at once. Both

```python
a, b, c = 1, 2, 3
```
and
```python
a, b, c = (1, 2, 3)
```
and
```python
a, b, c = (1, 2, 3)
```
will set `a = 1`, `b = 2`, and `c = 3`.
