<!-- 4. **Average Pig Turns** (Neller). What is the expected number of turns per solitaire game with a hold-at-20-or-goal play policy?  Simulate a given number of solitaire Pig games where a player rolls until a 1 ("pig") is rolled, or the turn total is greater than or equal to 20, or the score plus the turn total is greater than or equal to 100.  Report the average number of turns per game. *You'll wan't to copy Exercise "Hold-at-20-or-Goal Game" as a starting point.*

- Initially, prompt the user with "Games? ". (Larger numbers, will tend to yield better estimations.)
- After the simulations, print "Average turns: " followed by the average turns taken per simulated game.




5. **Two Player Pig** (Neller). Simulate a single solitaire game of Pig where a player rolls until a 1 ("pig") is rolled, or the turn total is greater than or equal to 20, or the score plus the turn total is greater than or equal to 100. *You'll wan't to copy Exercise "Hold-at-20-or-Goal Game" as a starting point.*

- Before each turn, print a line with "Player 1 score: " and player 1's score.  Print another line with "Player 2 score: " and player 2's score.  Finally, print a line with "It is player #'s turn.", where "#" is replaced by the current player number.  Play starts with player 1 and then alternates.
- For each roll, print a line with "Roll: " and the random die roll value (1-6).
- After a "pig" roll of 1, or a "hold", print a line with "Turn total: " followed by the turn total.  In the case of a "pig", this turn total is 0.  Then, print a line with "New score: " followed by the new score for the current player.




6. **First-Player Advantage** (Neller). There is an advantage to going first in Pig, but how big an advantage is it for “hold at 20 or goal” play?  We wish to estimate the probability of a first-player win with a hold-at-20-or-goal play policy.  Simulate a given number of two-player Pig games where a player rolls until a 1 ("pig") is rolled, or the turn total is greater than or equal to 20, or the score plus the turn total is greater than or equal to 100.  Report the fraction of games won by the first player. *You'll wan't to copy Exercise "Two Player Pig" as a starting point.*

- Initially, prompt the user with "Games? ". (Larger numbers, will tend to yield better estimations.)
- After the simulations, print "Probability of first player win: " followed by the fraction of simulated games won by the first player.
