# String Exercises

Complete the following exercises in a Jupyter notebook and then push the notebook to the "learning-python" repository in your GitHub account. **Above each exercise, create a markdown cell with an "H3" heading of the number of the exercise.**


1. Write a program that prints four lines with your (1) name, (2) year, (3) home town, and (4) reason for learning python.

2. Write a program that prints the following two lines:

> `This is how you print a double-quote ("), a backslash (\), and a lowercase o with stroke (Ã¸).`
>
> `A tab and a newline are printed using a "\t" and "\n", respectively.`

(You'll probably have to look something up.)

3. What is the 35th character in the word "super-duper-duper...-fun" where duper is repeated 10 times? How about the 35th character from the end?

4. Do some playing around and figure out how `len()` handles the newline character.

<!-- 5. For each string listed below, write a line of python that returns the string using a slice of "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz".

-

print("abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"[1::3]) -->
