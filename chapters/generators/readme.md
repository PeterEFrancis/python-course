iterators


To start, note that one-line for loops create a *generator* object, which we will explore more in the chapter on generators. For now, you don't need to know the specifics and you can just focus on the practical use.

Think of one-line for loops as creating an iterable sequence of objects. As you would imagine, these sequences can be can be passed into something that takes an iterable as an argument, such as `list()` or `join()`.
