# Input and Output Exercises

1. Edit your code for the following exercises so that instead of setting values of variables at the beginning of the program, you request for an input. (**Remember that `input()` always returns a string, so if you are asking for a  numbers, you must convert it.**) At the end of the exercise, print the result using a nice formatted print.
