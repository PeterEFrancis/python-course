# Introduction Exercises (CoCalc)

## Setting up CoCalc

1. Go to https://cocalc.com and sign in (create an account if you don't already have one).

3. Create a new folder with you and your partner's name (only one of you has to do this). This goes without saying, but don't mess with another person's folder.


## How to do Homework

These exercises will teach you the process you will go through when you are completing any other set of exercises.

1. Navigate to your folder in the CoCalc Project and create a new Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) named with the title of the chapter that the exercises are for. In this case, name the notebook "introduction".

2. Open the notebook.

3. Make the first cell a markdown cell with the dropdown menu, and make a "H1" heading that is the name of the chapter you are working on. In this case, type
```markdown
# introduction
```

4. Execute the cell to render the markdown by pressing "shift + enter" ("shift + return" on mac) or clicking the "Run" button.

5. Make sure that the next cell is a code cell by inspecting the drop down.

6. Type the following and execute the cell
  ```python
  print("Hello, World!")
  ```
  You should see an output:
  > `Hello, World!`

7. In the next cell, copy what you had in the previous cell and paste it three times.

8. Replace the "Hello, World!" text with something else (you could write a haiku!).

9. Add comments to the cell about whatever you would like, perhaps commenting on things you notice about jupyter or python so far.

10. Create another cell below the last one and change it to a markdown cell.

11. Write some markdown that uses at least five different styles. **Hint:** how do you underline, italicize, etc. ?

12. Save the document.
