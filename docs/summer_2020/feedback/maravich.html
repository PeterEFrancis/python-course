        <h3>5/26/20</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Ch2 ex4 -- can you show some errors and discuss what is presented in the error messages?</li>
          <li>Ch2 ex5 -- I guess I was a little unclear. What you did is correct, but I wwould have been satisfied with less work (see solutions).</li>
          <li>Ch2 ex9 -- not quite. Make sure you round to 2 decimal places.</li>
          <li>Ch2 ex10 -- close, but remember: you deposit an amount every month.</li>
          <li>Ch2 ex12 -- technically correct, but can you do it without using "if"?</li>
          <li>Ch2 ex13 -- 2 is the minimum, but a = 2 would make test4 and test5 both true.</li>
          <li>Ch3 ex3 -- please don't use reserved words like "str" as variable names!!</li>
          <li>Ch3 -- it was probably my fault, but the exercise numbering is off at the end.</li>
          <li>Great work so far!</li>
